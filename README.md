### Issue experienced:

(Insert any issues/difficulties experienced while coding and how the problem was solved)   

* #### Issue 1:  
   <p> The Favicon will not appear in the web browser.

   ##### Resolution: Issue resolved itself with no apparent reason.
___

* #### Issue 2:
   <p> Backstretch would not work when installed into js subdirectory and linked in the index.html file. The block element that was supposed to have a background image (the Header) only displayed a white background.   

   ##### Resolution: After researching, I found an answer on Stack Overflow. It was a syntax error. When creating the file, it was saved as backstretch.js. When pulling the code into index.html, the path was incorrectly typed. Once the syntax error was discovered, the correct path was typed and now backstretch is working as it should.
